# ðŸ§  LeetCode Solutions: Mastering Algorithms & Problem-Solving

Hi, this is a comprehensive repository where I solve and document **3000+ LeetCode problems**. This isn't just about acing technical interviews; it's about building an algorithmic mind that can tackle complex challenges, whether inside or outside the tech world.

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Goals**

1. **Master Core Algorithms**: Build an unshakable foundation across all algorithmic paradigms (DP, graphs, recursion, etc.).
2. **10x Problem-Solving Skills**: Strengthen my ability to approach new and unseen problems across domains.
3. **Teach & Document**: Each solution includes clear explanations, time complexity, and patterns.
4. **Consistency & Growth**: Solve problems daily while tracking patterns and weaknesses.

## ðŸ“š **Repository Structure**

```
leetcode/
â”œâ”€â”€ easy/       # Beginner-level problems
â”œâ”€â”€ medium/     # Intermediate-level problems
â””â”€â”€ hard/       # Advanced-level problems
```

### âœ… **Solution Format**

Each solution follows a consistent naming convention and includes detailed documentation:

```
{difficulty}/
â”œâ”€â”€ {problem_number}-{problem_name}.py
â””â”€â”€ .metadata.json (tag mappings)
```

Example:

```
medium/
â”œâ”€â”€ 0002-add-two-numbers.py
â””â”€â”€ .metadata.json
```

### ðŸ“Š **.metadata.json Example**

```json
{
  "0002": {
    "title": "Add Two Numbers",
    "tags": ["Linked List", "Math"],
    "difficulty": "medium"
  },
  "0124": {
    "title": "Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum",
    "tags": ["Tree", "Dynamic Programming"],
    "difficulty": "hard"
  }
}
```

## ðŸš€ **Roadmap to 3000+ Problems**

1. **Phase 1 (Months 1-3)**: 500 foundational problems across 12 core techniques.
2. **Phase 2 (Months 4-9)**: 1000 intermediate problems with deeper algorithmic approaches.
3. **Phase 3 (Months 10-18)**: 1500+ expert-level problems, advanced topics, etc.

## ðŸ“Œ **How to Navigate**

1. Browse by **difficulty**: Start with `easy/` and work toward `hard/`.
2. Explore **algorithms**: Use `.metadata.json` to locate problems by technique.
3. Learn & contribute: Each solution is fully documented. Open issues or PRs for enhancements!
